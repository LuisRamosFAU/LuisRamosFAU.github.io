  Experience in computer engineering include my previous intern position at Skyline Communications, developing the back and front-end of their Dataminer System written in XML and C#. I was involved in two University projects: the development of a workout/gym app similar to Uber and Tinder as well as a two semester design project building an elderly focused smart assistant in the form of a puppy, following the user similar to how an iRobot Roomba works. Last semester I took Internet Computing, a course which changed the way I viewed this career path. It introduced me to HTML, Javascript, MySQL, the LAMP environment among other languages. I was able to com- plete a website focused on filtering phone carrier prices; which later lead to the development of a workout/gym site similar to Uber and Tinder. My last semester gave me experience with Python though a whole course dedicated to it where I excelled while developing a different take on the classic snake game using C, a 3x4 Keypad, 2x16 I2C LCD & an Arduino. Currently, I am devel- oping an app to serve as a user profile on allergen and lactose information for restaurants by us- ing SwiftUI, JSON & Firebase under the Cocobolo Group from Boca Raton, FL, as their iOS Mobile App Developer intern. This as well as projects involving my FAU engineering student server, where I extracted and recorded data to it using SQL, have given me the chance to use my creativity in a professional and educational environment.
