Experience in computer engineering include my previous intern position at Skyline Communications, developing back and front-end of their Dataminer System in XML and C#. Two University projects: the development of a workout/gym app like Uber and Tinder & a two semester design project. Here I built an elderly focused smart assistant in the form of a puppy, recognizing the user and moving similar to how an iRobot Roomba works. Courses introduced me to HTML, CSS and MySQL to complete a sites focused on filtering phone carrier prices. This lead to the development of the workout/gym site. 2020 gave me experience with SQL, C and Python though a whole course dedicated to these where I excelled while developing a different take on the classic snake game with a 3x4 Keypad, 2x16 I2C LCD & an Arduino. Currently I am iOS Developer, developing an app to serve as user profiles on allergen and lactose information for restaurants through SwiftUI, JSON, Figma & Firebase. This as well as projects involving my FAU engineering student server, where I extracted and recorded data to it using SQL, have given me the chance to use my creativity in a professional and educational environment.  <br><br>
