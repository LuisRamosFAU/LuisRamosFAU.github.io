  A great education makes anything possible. Fortunate for my deep problem solving skills from pursuing Mechanical Engineering. Now, my passion is in growing my understanding in the field of Computer Engineering. 

Involved in University projects from the development of a workout/gym site Ã  la Uber/Tinder, to a design project building an elderly focused smart assistant in the form of a puppy, to tackle loneliness. 

My internship at Skyline Communications, with their DataMiner program, and courses sharpening coding, networking & hardware building skills has lead me to my current endeavor: developing a varied take on the classic Snake Game using an Arduino, Keypad & LCD while developing an app serving as user's profile on allergen and lactose information for restaurants.

  Experience in computer engineering include my previous intern position at Skyline Communications, developing the back and front-end of their Dataminer System written in XML and C#. I was involved in two University projects: the development of a workout/gym app similar to Uber and Tinder as well as a two semester design project building an elderly focused smart assistant in the form of a puppy, following the user similar to how an iRobot Roomba works. Last semester I took Internet Computing, a course which changed the way I viewed this career path. It introduced me to HTML, Javascript, MySQL, the LAMP environment among other languages. I was able to com- plete a website focused on filtering phone carrier prices; which later lead to the development of a workout/gym site similar to Uber and Tinder. My last semester gave me experience with Python though a whole course dedicated to it where I excelled while developing a different take on the classic snake game using C, a 3x4 Keypad, 2x16 I2C LCD & an Arduino. Currently, I am devel- oping an app to serve as a user profile on allergen and lactose information for restaurants by us- ing SwiftUI, JSON & Firebase under the Cocobolo Group from Boca Raton, FL, as their iOS Mobile App Developer intern. This as well as projects involving my FAU engineering student server, where I extracted and recorded data to it using SQL, have given me the chance to use my creativity in a professional and educational environment.
