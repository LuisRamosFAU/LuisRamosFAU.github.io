  A great education makes anything possible. Fortunate for my deep problem solving skills from Mechanical Engineering. I now strive to grow my skills in the field of Computer Engineering. Involved in University projects from developing a workout/gym site Ã  la Uber/Tinder, to a designing an elderly focused smart assistant in the form of a puppy, to tackle loneliness.

  My internship at Skyline Communications, their DataMiner program, courses sharpening coding, networking & hardware skills lead to my current endeavor: developing a varied take on the classic Snake Game while developing an app serving as user's profile on allergen and lactose information for restaurants.
